# Test Driven Javascript Assessment

A set of tasks to assesses the skills of a candidate for a Javascript position, or to evaluate and improve one's own skills.

Largely inspired by Rebecca Murphy's JS assessment (https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment).

## Topics covered

✅ Core Language Features

- Arrays: Comprehensive coverage including creation, manipulation, iteration, higher-order methods
- Strings: Extensive string operations, search, validation, transformation
- Numbers: Digit manipulation, mathematical operations, analysis
- Objects: Creation, property manipulation, methods, copying
- Functions: Arguments, scope, closures, higher-order functions, currying, partial application
- Classes: ES6 classes, inheritance, prototypes, method overriding
- Async Programming: Promises, async/await, Promise.all/race/allSettled, promisification, sequential processing

✅ Advanced Concepts

- Design Patterns: Comprehensive coverage of creational, structural, and behavioral patterns
- Generators: Generator functions, iterators, custom iteration protocols
- Browser APIs: DOM manipulation, event handling, storage APIs
- Timers: setTimeout, setInterval, debouncing, throttling
- Flow Control: Conditional logic, loop control, basic error handling, state machines and control flow patterns

✅ Algorithm Fundamentals

- Basic algorithmic thinking (Fibonacci, steps pattern)

## What's Missing for Senior-Level JavaScript:

❌ Critical Gaps

### Memory Management & Performance

- Garbage collection understanding
- Memory leaks identification and prevention
- Performance optimization techniques
- Profiling and measurement

### Regular Expressions

- Pattern matching
- Complex regex operations
- Lookaheads/lookbehinds

### Data Serialization

- JSON parsing/stringification
- Custom serialization logic
- Data validation

### Web APIs & Modern Browser Features

- Fetch API
- Service Workers
- Web Workers
- IndexedDB
- WebSockets
- File API

### TypeScript Integration (if applicable)

- Type annotations
- Interfaces and generics
- Type guards

### Security Considerations

- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection
- Input sanitization

### Advanced Async Patterns

- Reactive programming concepts
- Stream processing
- Backpressure handling
